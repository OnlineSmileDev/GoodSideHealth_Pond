Sometimes sore throats can be caused by serious illnesses like abscesses (pockets of pus) around or behind the tonsils. Currently the provider does not feel that the cause of you/your child’s sore throat is dangerous or requires the use of antibiotics. Treatment can include rest, increasing fluids especially warm or cool liquids, throat lozenges or sore throat lollipops as appropriate and Tylenol/Motrin for pain as directed. \nGo to the ER for worsening pain despite medication, difficulties with breathing/swallowing, concerns for dehydration, more ill-appearing or new concerning symptoms.  \nIf symptoms persist past 48-72 hours without improvement or if new symptoms develop, please return to the nurse’s office for a repeat evaluation and strep test when appropriate or follow up with your PCP as directed.',

          "You or your child had a rapid SARS antigen test (COVID-19 test) that was positive. You or your child will need to quarantine at home based on either CDC recommendations (5 days from the onset of symptoms, with an additional 5 days masked in public) or your district policy ***whichever is longer. To come off quarantine on day 5, symptoms will need to be improving and fever resolved for at least 24 hours without fever reducing medications. Household family members will need to quarantine per CDC guidelines from the date of the last unmasked exposure. Guidelines vary depending on vaccination status. Vaccinated family members who have received their second dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine within the last 6 months or have had their booster do not need to quarantine at home but must wear a mask for 10 days from the date of the last unmasked exposure while at home and in public. Non vaccinated individuals, individuals who are not fully vaccinated, or those who have not received a booster and it has been longer than 6 months since their second dose must quarantine for 10 days from the date of the last unmasked exposure knowing it can take up to 14 days to develop symptoms. If you or a family member fall into this category you may test on day 5 of the last unmasked exposure and if negative and symptom free may come off quarantine but must wear a mask at home and in public for an additional 5 days. It is important all family members practice social distancing at home, adhere to good hand hygiene and wear a mask around the infected individual until they are off quarantine. Currently there are a handful of EUA approved therapies to treat Covid-19. If you are interested in these therapies, please reach out to your primary care provider. At home, please give/take Tylenol (acetaminophen) every 4-6 hours as needed for fever, headache, and body aches. Drink plenty of fluids to maintain hydration. Symptoms of COVID-19 may last for several days. You or your child is no longer considered contagious with COVID-19 once you/he/she is 10 days post symptom onset or positive test, if asymptomatic, so long as the last 24 hours of the 10-day period you/he/she is fever free (without the use of Tylenol), and your/his/her symptoms have resolved and/or significantly improved. Retesting for COVID-19 is not needed to confirm that the illness has resolved if the above criteria has been met. If you your child develops rapid breathing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, chest pain, has prolonged fever lasting longer than 5 days or there are concerns for dehydration, please proceed to your nearest Emergency Room to be evaluated. If fever subsides and returns this can be a sign of a secondary infection or inflammatory response and requires prompt attention. If your child participates in sports, it is recommended that he/she not participate in athletic activities until he/she has been symptom free for at least 2 weeks and has been cleared by their Pediatrician and or follows gradual return to play guidelines per district policy. Please follow up with you/your child's primary care provider in the next 72 hours and sooner for any concerns.",

These results represent a snapshot of the time around specimen collection and could change if the same test was performed again in one or more days and even hours. Individuals who have received 2 doses of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine with the second dose in the last 6 months or have had a booster do not need to quarantine at home but must wear a mask in public and when unable to socially distance for 10 days from the date of the last unmasked exposure. Unvaccinated individuals, those who are not fully vaccinated or if it has been longer than 6 months since the second dose and a booster has not been given will need to quarantine for 10 days from the date of the last unmasked exposure. If a negative test is obtained day 5 of exposure or after, and an individual remains asymptomatic, the individual may come off quarantine but must remained masked in public or when unable to socially distance for the full 10 days. Symptoms may occur up to 14 days after exposure but are more likely to occur in the first 10 days. If negative tests results were obtained prior to day 5 of exposure, you may test again on day 5 or after an if asymptomatic and negative may come off quarantine but need to remain masked in public and when unable to socially distance. Unvaccinated individuals with no known exposure who are asymptomatic do not need to quarantine at this time but it is recommended to take steps to minimize spread by wearing a mask in public, practicing social distancing, and performing hand hygiene. If you are 12 or older and are interested in getting the Covid-19 vaccine, please reach out to your primary care provider or local public health authority. ',
